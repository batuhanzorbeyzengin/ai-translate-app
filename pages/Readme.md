## Why did I opt for pages/api?

After the stable release of Nextjs 13 beta, I haven't had the chance to explore the new structure. So, I chose the method I'm most familiar with.
The reason I haven't had the opportunity is because I've been heavily involved in development on both the ReactJS and NodeJS fronts for some time now.
