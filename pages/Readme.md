## Why did I opt for pages/api?

After the stable release of Nextjs 13 beta, I haven't had the chance to explore the new structure. So, I chose the method I'm most familiar with.
The reason I haven't had the opportunity is because I've been heavily involved in development on both the ReactJS and NodeJS fronts for some time now.

## Why choose OpenAI for text generation?

I had planned to use the Google Speech-to-Text API, but due to the lack of a credit card, I was unable to use the API. Since a friend of mine has an OpenAI API account, I used that instead. I am aware that this does not meet the requirements. I want to make a criticism on this issue. In such a case, you should have provided us with the API url and the API key. After all, the topic isn't about which platform you used to do this.
